## My process

I start with mobile-first HTML content. Then I define the CSS. I start working on the outermost div inward and work until the layout looks the way I want it to. I do the individual details last, font, colors, etc.

I use CSS custom properties as much as possible, setting them up in the root of the project.
This means that if I want to change a property, for example a color or a font; I only
have to change the variable in the root and all the instances are updated.

The last task is responsive views for tablet and desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- @font-face rules w/ Figtree Google font
